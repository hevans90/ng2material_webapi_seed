# ng2material_webapi_seed
The angular 2 'Tour of Heroes' start project re-written in ng2 material, and with a light .NET Web API attached

##The Web API
The `.sln` file in the repo will open the C# project in Visual Studio. Build this using the default build config and run it to host the API locally

##The Angular2 Front-End
The front-end is built with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), simply open the `HeroesWeb` folder in a terminal, `npm install` to get the necessary `node_modules` and `ng serve` to run it
